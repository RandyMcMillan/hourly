## Who are you?

I'm Asher, a data scientist from NASA. I've been a full time freelancer since Feb. 2019.

## Why have you done this?

I created hourly because I needed a free hour tracking tool that would
be easy to use and not get in the way of my add/commit/push workflow.

Hourly differs from many other tools in the following ways:

* it's super simple - you commit with a clock-in/out message
* it doesn't require a database that needs to be managed separately
* it doesn't spy on you
* you can be as transparent as you want to be: If you want people to know you're on the clock, just push your clock-in message.
Conversely, if you don't want to be bothered, push a clock-out message.

These features should make Hourly ideal for freelancers and remote workers.
