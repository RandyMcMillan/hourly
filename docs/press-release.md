# Hourly integrates BTCPayserver

Hourly is a command-line time tracking tool that lets developers clock in and out of git repos, create timesheets, visualize workloads, and issue invoices, all by creating and parsing commit messages. Hourly is privacy-focused: it won't spy on you, but assumes you report honestly. The new integration with BTCPay server means you can generate lightning and bitcoin invoices in a single command.
